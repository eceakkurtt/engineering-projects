# Switchable Counter & Variable Pulse Generator

A digital system integrating a switchable BCD counter and a variable-duty-cycle pulse generator. The design includes clock generation using astable multivibrators, CMOS-based signal routing with a 2×2 multiplexer, and D flip-flop logic to support counting by 1 or 2 steps.

## What I did
- Designed and implemented the counter and pulse generator architecture
- Built and tested clock, multiplexer, and flip-flop blocks
- Verified the system through LTspice simulations and physical breadboard implementation

## Files
- `Final_Report.pdf` — project report and documentation

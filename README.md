# Engineering Projects

This repository contains selected academic engineering projects completed during my undergraduate studies in Electrical and Electronics Engineering.

## Project Overview

- **COMA1_ProjectileMotion**  
  Experimental analysis of projectile motion with air resistance using camera-based tracking and theoretical modeling.

- **COMA2_RC_Circuit**  
  Design and experimental study of RC circuit time response, including analytical solutions and real measurements.

- **COMA3_AngularOscillations**  
  Investigation of torsional oscillations and moment of inertia through physical experiments and data analysis.

- **ESD1_CapacitorDesign**  
  Design and testing of parallel-plate and cylindrical capacitors, supported by analytical calculations and LTspice simulations.

- **ESD2_HelmholtzCoil**  
  Design and experimental characterization of a Helmholtz coil system for generating uniform magnetic fields.

- **SAPA_Stethoscope**  
  Digital stethoscope system for biomedical signal acquisition and frequency-domain analysis.

## Notes
All projects include experimental measurements, theoretical analysis, and supporting documentation.

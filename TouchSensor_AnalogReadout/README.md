# Touch Sensor Interface & Analog Circuit Design

Analogue capacitive sensor readout circuit designed to detect small capacitance variations in the 60–70 pF range. The system consists of a Wien bridge oscillator, a transistor-level common emitter amplifier, and an AC–DC conversion stage.

The circuit was first analyzed in LTspice and then implemented and tested experimentally. Oscilloscope measurements confirmed a clear and repeatable DC output voltage increase when the sensor capacitance changed due to touch.
